# E-Learning Recommendation System

A sophisticated learning recommendation system that provides personalized study materials and predicts student success through customized learning pathways.

üéØ Project Overview

This project implements two main components:

1. Study Material Recommendation System: Personalizes study material recommendations based on student profiles and engagement metrics.

2. Learning Pathway Generator: Creates customized learning pathways and predicts successful outcomes using machine learning.

**Key Features**

**Study Material Recommender**

1. Personalized Recommendations:

 --> Tailored to student profiles, including course and year.

--> Based on performance history from previous assessments.

--> Considers student interest areas.

--> Factors in material popularity and peer engagement.

**Targeted Suggestions:**

Aims to enhance academic success through curated study materials.

**Learning Pathway Generator**

**Customized Pathways:**

a. Develops 5-step learning pathways integrating study materials with quizzes.

b. Adapts dynamically to student engagement patterns.

**Success Prediction:
**
1. Predicts pathway completion likelihood using Random Forest Classifier.

2. Features include historical engagement patterns, past performance, and interactive content participation.
